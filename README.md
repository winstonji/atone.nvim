## How it relates to nvim's built-in `:undotree`?

The built-in undotree is great — it ships with Neovim, requires zero setup, and covers the basics well. If that's all you need, stick with it.
atone.nvim is for people who want a bit more. Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature                | nvim 0.12 `:undotree` | atone.nvim                                  |
| ---                    | ---                   | ---                                         |
| Setup                  | None (built-in)       | Plugin install                              |
| Tree visualization     | Basic                 | Standard + compact                          |
| Diff preview           | No                    | TreeSitter highlighted + word-level inline  |
| Node marks             | No                    | Persistent, numbered, named, fuzzy-findable |
| Custom labels          | No                    | Yes                                         |
| Auto-attach to buffers | No                    | Yes                                         |
| Customization          | Limited               | Highly                                      |

Both have their place, pick what fits your workflow.

## Installation

You can install `atone.nvim` using your favorite plugin manager. Here comes a example for *lazy.nvim*

```lua
{
    "XXiaoA/atone.nvim",
    cmd = "Atone",
    ---@module "atone"
    ---@type AtoneConfig
    opts = {},
}
```

## Commands

The main command is `:Atone`. It has the following subcommands:

| Command                   | Description                               |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------  |
| `:Atone` or `:Atone open` | Opens the undo tree view.                 |
| `:Atone toggle`           | Toggles the undo tree view on and off.    |
| `:Atone close`            | Closes the undo tree view.                |
| `:Atone focus`            | Moves the cursor to the undo tree window. |

## Configuration

You can configure `atone.nvim` by passing a table to the `setup` function. Here are the default options:

```lua
require("atone").setup({
    layout = {
        ---@type "left"|"right"
        direction = "left",
        --- Keep the tree, diff, and source buffer within the window that opened Atone.
        --- When false, place the tree at the tab-page edge and equalize other windows.
        localized = false,
        ---@type "adaptive"|number
        --- adaptive: adapt to width of tree graph
        --- float < 1: width = invoking-window width * value when localized, otherwise vim.o.columns * value
        --- integer >= 1: absolute width
        width = 0.25,
    },
    -- diff for the node under cursor
    -- shown under the tree graph
    diff_cur_node = {
        enabled = true,
        --- float < 1: percentage of the tree graph window height
        --- integer >= 1: absolute row count
        height = 0.3,
        ---@type "adaptive"|"full"|number
        --- adaptive: same width as tree window
        --- full: diff matches the invoking buffer width; tree spans the combined source and diff height
        --- float < 1: width = vim.o.columns * value
        --- integer >= 1: absolute width
        --- Note that numeric values create a float diff window anchored to a hidden
        --- dummy split window. this is an implementation detail that may cause
        --- unexpected edge-case bugs in certain window layouts.
        width = "full",
        -- Use TreeSitter to highlight the source code inside diff hunks.
        treesitter = true,
        -- Highlight the exact changed word ranges inside modified lines.
        inline_diff = true,
    },
    -- automatically update the buffer that the tree is attached to
    -- only works for buffer whose buftype is <empty>
    auto_attach = {
        enabled = true,
        excluded_ft = { "oil" },
    },
    marks = {
        persist = true,
        persist_path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/atone_marks.json",
        --- finders are tried in order. "builtin" is always available.
        finders = { "fzf-lua", "telescope", "builtin" },
    },
    keymaps = {
        tree = {
            quit = { "<C-c>", "q" },
            next_node = "j", -- support v:count
            pre_node = "k", -- support v:count
            jump_to_G = "G",
            jump_to_gg = "gg",
            undo_to = "<CR>",
            set_mark = "m",
            delete_mark = { "x", "X" },
            delete_all_marks = "dM",
            goto_mark = { "'", "`" },
            mark_picker = "s",
            help = { "?", "g?" },
            float_diff = "gd",
        },
        auto_diff = {
            quit = { "<C-c>", "q" },
            help = { "?", "g?" },
            undo = "u",
            redo = "<C-r>",
            float_diff = "gd",
        },
        help = {
            quit_help = { "<C-c>", "q" },
        },
    },
    diff_float = {
        --- width of the diff float as a fraction of the editor width (0–1)
        width = 0.8,
        --- height of the diff float as a fraction of the editor height (0–1)
        height = 0.8,
        --- close the centred diff float when it loses focus.
        autoclose = true,
    },
    ui = {
        -- refer to `:h 'winborder'`
        border = "single",
        -- compact graph style
        compact = true,
        -- Draw the undo tree with git branch drawing symbols (U+F5D0-U+F60D).
        -- "auto": enable when the terminal renders them natively
        --   (kitty >= 0.36.2, wezterm >= 2025-04-15, ghostty >= 1.0).
        -- true: force enable. false: disable.
        branch_symbols = "auto",
        node_label = {
            custom = false,
            ---@param ctx AtoneNodeLabelContext
            ---@return AtoneNodeLabel
            formatter = function(ctx)
                return string.format(
                    "[%d] %s %s%s",
                    ctx.seq,
                    ctx.h_time,
                    ctx.bookmark or "",
                    ctx.is_sticky_ref and " [=]" or ""
                )
            end,
            extmark_opts = { strict = false },
        },
    },
})
```

### Graph Symbols

With `ui.branch_symbols = "auto"` (the default), the undo tree is drawn with the [git branch drawing symbols](https://github.com/rbong/flog-symbols) codepoints (`U+F5D0`-`U+F60D`) introduced by [vim-flog](https://github.com/rbong/vim-flog) when the terminal renders them natively, and falls back to the classic box-drawing characters otherwise. All terminals that support them use the **same codepoints** and render the glyphs themselves (no font needed):
- kitty >= 0.36.2
- wezterm >= 2025-04-15
- ghostty >= 1.0

Other terminals need a patched font such as [flog-symbols](https://github.com/rbong/flog-symbols) to show the glyphs at all, and even then the connecting lines are not guaranteed to line up.

Detection relies on environment signals that do not survive SSH, so remote sessions fall back to the classic symbols; set `branch_symbols = true` explicitly to force them.

### Custom Labels

The tree uses the built-in label format by default. If you want full control over the label, turn on `ui.node_label.custom` and provide a `formatter(ctx)`.

```lua
require("atone").setup({
    ui = {
        node_label = {
            custom = true,
            ---@param ctx AtoneNodeLabelContext
            ---@return AtoneNodeLabel
            formatter = function(ctx)
                local sticky = ctx.is_sticky_ref and " [=]" or ""
                return string.format("[%d] %s %s%s", ctx.seq, ctx.h_time, ctx.bookmark or "", sticky)
            end,
        },
    },
})
```

Available fields on `ctx`:

| Field            | Type                                   | Description                                       |
| ---              | ---                                    | ---                                               |
| `seq`            | `integer`                              | Undo sequence number of the node                  |
| `is_current`     | `boolean`                              | Whether this node is the current undo state       |
| `is_sticky_ref`  | `boolean`                              | Whether this node is the pinned sticky diff base  |
| `time`           | `integer`                              | Raw timestamp from Neovim's undotree              |
| `h_time`         | `string`                               | Human-readable time string                        |
| `bookmark`       | `string?`                              | Bookmark label text, e.g. `{a}`                   |
| `diff`           | `{ added: integer, removed: integer }` | Added/removed line counts for the node            |

Things to know:

- Fixed labels (`custom = false`) are built for the whole tree when the tree is refreshed.
- Custom labels only write label text for the visible part of the tree.
- When the viewport moves, the old visible range is restored to the plain graph text and the new visible range gets fresh label text.
- Highlight groups returned by chunked labels are applied only for the currently visible label range.
- Fixed-label highlighting is not used in custom mode. If you want highlighted custom labels, return highlighted chunks.

You may return either a plain string or a list of text chunks.

Plain string example:

```lua
formatter = function(ctx)
    local sticky = ctx.is_sticky_ref and " [=]" or ""
    return string.format("[%d] %s %s%s", ctx.seq, ctx.h_time, ctx.bookmark or "", sticky)
end
```

Chunked example with per-segment highlight groups:

```lua
formatter = function(ctx)
    return {
        "[",
        { ctx.seq, ctx.is_current and "AtoneCurrentNode" or "AtoneSeq" },
        "] ",
        { ctx.h_time, "Comment" },
        ctx.bookmark and " " or "",
        { ctx.bookmark or "", "AtoneMark" },
        ctx.is_sticky_ref and " " or "",
        ctx.is_sticky_ref and { "[=]", "AtoneStickyRef" } or "",
    }
end
```

When you return chunks, chunks with a highlight group are highlighted and chunks without one are shown as normal text.

### Keymap Actions

The `keymaps` table in the configuration allows you to map keys to specific actions in different windows. The keys can be a single string or a table of strings.

Here are the available actions and their default keybindings:

| Action             | Default Key(s) | Description                                                     |
| ---                | ---            | ---                                                             |

## Highlighting

`atone.nvim` uses the following highlight groups. You can customize them as what you did for normal highlight groups.

| Highlight Group         | Default                   | Description                                       |
| ---                     | ---                       | ---                                               |
